Win rate gets talked about far more than it deserves. Risk to reward is the number that decides whether a strategy makes money, and understanding it properly matters more than treating it as a vague "good ratio" you're supposed to aim for.

## The maths

{{< figure src="risk-reward.png" caption="Entry in the middle, risk below (red), reward above (teal). Here the reward is roughly three times the risk." >}}

Risk to reward is just the distance to your target divided by the distance to your stop, so risking £50 to make £150 is a 3:1 ratio, usually written as 3R. The breakeven win rate for any given R:R is 1 ÷ (1 + R), which at 3R works out to 25%, meaning you can be wrong three times out of every four and still break even before costs. At 1R you need 50% just to break even, so the ratio does a lot of the work before a single trade is even taken.

## Why win rate alone is misleading

A 70% win rate sounds excellent on its own, but it can still lose money if the losers are three times the size of the winners, and a 30% win rate sounds mediocre even though it can be genuinely profitable at 3R or better. Look at either number in isolation and you're looking at half a story, so whenever a strategy gets pitched on win rate alone, that's the first thing worth asking about.

*Example: ten trades, seven winners at 0.5R and three losers at 1R, comes out to 3.5R made against 3R lost, barely scraping by despite a 70% win rate. Ten trades, three winners at 3R and seven losers at 1R, comes out to 9R made against 7R lost instead, considerably better from a worse-looking win rate.*

## Where most people go wrong

The ratio gets decided the moment you set your stop and target, and then it's quietly abandoned the moment the trade is open. Moving a stop further away to avoid being wrong turns a planned 1R loss into an unplanned 2R one, while taking profit early out of nerves turns a planned 3R winner into a 1R one, and both of those wreck the maths just as effectively as taking a genuinely bad setup. This is the exact mistake covered in [The importance of targets](/blog/2026-07-08-the-importance-of-targets/), where a clean entry with no exit plan behaves like a coin flip regardless of how good the entry was.

## Setting it before you're in the trade

Know your invalidation, the point where the idea is simply wrong, before you know your target. That's your stop. Then find a realistic target based on actual structure, the next level, the next zone, the next swing point, rather than just wherever gives you a nice round number. If the resulting ratio doesn't clear whatever minimum you've set for yourself, that's the thing to catch before risking anything, not after.

## Key takeaways

- R:R = reward distance ÷ risk distance; breakeven win rate = 1 ÷ (1 + R)
- A high win rate can still lose money, and a low win rate can still be profitable: neither means anything alone
- The ratio is set when the stop and target are placed, and it only survives if both are respected once the trade is live
- Moving a stop or cutting a winner early quietly destroys the ratio you planned for
- Set the stop first (invalidation), then find a realistic target from actual structure, not a round number
